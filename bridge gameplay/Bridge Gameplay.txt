Objective:
Create AI that can win 70% of the time when bidding

Deep Q-learning (Reinforcement Learning)


Bidding:

States: 

(x, y) representation of cards (26)
0/1 List of suits each other player has made a bid on, clockwise (15)
(x, y) for current bid (2)

Total: 43

Output:
All possible bids (36)
(0, 0), (1-7, 0-4)

Total: 36

Hidden layer nodes: 79*2/3 = 51 (maybe)

43 -> 50 -> 36
